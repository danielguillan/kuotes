    I love to collect quotes about design. They inspire me, they give me strength and mental clarity. Some tools like Evernote and Gimmebar –amongst many others– are great for the job but they're not that good at displaying quotes in a nice and readable manner. I wanted a place with the right experience: a clean and easy to read feed with beautiful typography. No UI, no social sharing buttons, no ads, no distractions. Just clarity. That's why I created this site.

The type is set in Adobe Garamond Pro and is served by [Typekit](https://typekit.com/ "Typekit - Web fonts").
