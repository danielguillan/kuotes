#Kuotes

[Kuotes](http://danielguillan.github.io/kuotes/) is a growing collection of inspiring quotes on Design, Minimalism, Simplicity, Focus, … curated by [Daniel Guillan](http://danielguillan.com).

## The idea

I love to collect quotes on design. They inspire me, they give me strength and mental clarity. Some tools like Evernote and Gimmebar –amongst many others– are great for the job but they're not that good at displaying quotes in a **nice and readable manner**. I wanted a place with the right experience: **a clean and easy to read feed** with **beautiful typography**. No UI, no social sharing buttons, no ads, no distractions. Just clarity. That's why I created this site.

## Colophon

Kuotes is built on [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com// "Middleman – The static site generator behind kuot.es"), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/ "SASS") + [Compass](http://compass-style.org/ "The Compass framework") and [Responder](https://github.com/danielguillan/responder "Responder - Magic media queries for your Compass project"). The type is set in Adobe Garamond Pro and is served by [Typekit](https://typekit.com/fonts/adobe-garamond-pro "Adobe Garamond Pro web font on Typekit"). The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/danielguillan/kuotes "The Kuotes repo on Github").
